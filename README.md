## MPNN for Throughput Inference of Optical Core Networks

This project houses the code for 'Intelligent-Performance-Inference-a-Graph-Neural-Network-Approach-to-Modelling-Maximum-Achievable-T', which looks at whether message passing neural networks (MPNN) can learn complex topology properties of optical core networks.

* train.py houses all the training code
* test.py houses all code to test the models
* mpnn_model.py defines all the model structures
* data.py has code to read the data files provided

Training, test data and trained models can be accessed via:
